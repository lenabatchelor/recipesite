<h2>Burnt Basque Cheesecake</h2>

<p>The Burnt Basque Cheesecake is a crustless, creamy cheesecake known for its 
    deeply caramelized top and custard-like center. Originating from the Basque 
    region of Spain, it's intentionally baked at a high temperature to achieve 
    it's signature “burnt” look and rich flavor.</p>

    <h2>Inredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600 g cream cheese (room temperature)</li>
        <li>250 g granulated sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>300 ml heavy cream (double cream)</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour (optional, for slightly firmer texture)</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Directions</h2>

   <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 210°C (410°F). Line a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan with parchment paper, letting it overhang for easy removal.</li>
        <li>Beat the cream cheese and sugar together in a large bowl until smooth and creamy — about 2–3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Pour in the heavy cream and vanilla extract, mixing until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour (if using) and add the pinch of salt, gently folding until smooth.</li> 
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and tap lightly to remove air bubbles.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50–60 minutes, until the top is deeply browned and the center still jiggles slightly when shaken.</li>
        <li>Cool completely at room temperature, then chill for a few hours (or overnight) before serving.</li>
    </ol>
